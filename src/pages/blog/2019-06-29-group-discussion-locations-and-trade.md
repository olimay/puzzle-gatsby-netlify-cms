### Some two point trade routes.

Oxter and Decubus

- From Oxter: clothes and armors
- From Decubus: specialty manufactured tools and equipment

Frondeur and Borborygmus

- Frondeur: cultivated plants and seeds
- Borborygmus: food, and wild plants and seeds gathered from around the world

Fankle and Matou

- Fankle: specialty clays
- Matou: machinery

### Other notes

Gaberlunz exports specialty handicrafts and some foods.

Decubus likely has a massive trade network.

### Questions

If Frondeur is home to plant science, is there a place that is home to insect science?

What are the mega trade hubs of the world? Could underwater people be involved?

### The genealogy of governments and institutions in not-so good places in the world

In the period after the Builder collapse and about 200 years before Delve, there was a long conflict between the various Dwarf kingdoms and the Empire (Drow).

During this time the Empire fought to control the Els Zev region. It also controlled many of the large islands in the Biashara. The exception was Macheon, which resisted its influence.

The Empire collapsed, but part of it morphed into the Company, which made more significant inroads into Macheon in the decades leading up to Delve then the Empire ever had. It was ultimately unsuccessful.

It's likely that many places in the Biashara that aren't doing so well during the time of PUZZLE take many harmful cultural or even pseudo-religious beliefs from the period of the Empire.

These might include places that are doing okay in some sense—maybe militarily—but are authoritarian, or just bad places to live.

### Tying in Decubus history

In a previous discussion, we were thinking that Decubus might have been a minor town near a once thriving shipbuilding district and a famous shipyard. For whatever reason, the shipyard fell into disrepair, or maybe was damaged several centuries ago. Most of the talent left and ethnic, religious, and other social tensions kept the area from prospering.

What Decubus has been doing recently: even if it's a stratified society, it has begun to break down barriers.

Okay, what I think might be the case instead: many of the people living in Decubus are from smaller countries in the Biashara. Maybe there were people populating slums in this area, many of them hoping to make it in Chantar, but not having the skill or connections.

The immigration is probably important in the trade network of Decubus and also reshaping the societies of countries that had been left behind for centuries.
